# InterviewTask
## AFS .NET Developer Test
### Write a simple ASP.NET MVC application that takes a text string from the user and turns it into "l33tsp34k".
#### -Don't worry, you don't have to implement the translation yourself - use one the APIs available at http://funtranslations.com/api

#### -Make sure you record all the calls and results, because we may need to analyse them at some point in the future.

#### -Data table is required for records with search and filter options.
#### -Use Ajax and JQuery where it suits you.
#### -Write it as if this is an enterprise system that will have to be maintained by others in the future.

#### -Manage dependencies and unit tests using the method that you feel most comfortable with.

#### -Build Interface and abstraction with appropriate MVC model.
#### -Using stored procedures is a plus.
#### -User authentication is a plus.
## This is a very small application, but set it up in a way that you feel is extendable as we may want to add other translators in the future.
